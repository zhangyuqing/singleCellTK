\title{Plot the percent of the variation that is explained by batch and condition
in the data}
\usage{
plotBatchVariance(inSCE, useAssay = "logcounts", batch,
  condition = NULL, log_dat = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{inSCE}{Input SCtkExperiment object. Required}

\item{useAssay}{Indicate which assay to use for PCA. Default is "logcounts"}

\item{batch}{The column in the annotation data that corresponds to batch.
Required}

\item{condition}{The column in the annotation data that corresponds to
condition. Optional}

\item{log_dat}{If TRUE log transform the input assay}
}
\value{
A boxplot of variation explained by batch, condition, and
batch+condition (if applicable).
}
\description{
Visualize the percent variation in the data that is explained by batch and
condition if it is given.
